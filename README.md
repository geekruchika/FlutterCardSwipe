# FlutterCardSwipe

## Card Swipe Animation

I was creating the swipe view as used in Tinder. Swipe right is considered accepted, and swipe left is rejected. It is a rebuild version of a UI design that I came across on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2216416-Showtime-app).

You can also check out the flow of the animation and the steps to design it briefly in my medium article [Tinder Swipe in Flutter](https://blog.geekyants.com/tinder-swipe-in-flutter-7e4fc56021bc)
